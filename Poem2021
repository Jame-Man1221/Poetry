Cold moist air against my warm skin,
Bitter wind, my open cuts sting,
It's only midweek, fancy that?
Full steam ahead, weekly combat,
Starting my day, what to expect?
Poetry write was not my plan,
Researcher not poet I am,
Github fun, with Geoff i respect.

I'm starting to code and program,
At least here I dont have to cram!
GitHub is surprisingly good;
I would write software if I could.
Maybe one day I will have time
As I am drowning in coursework!
DataCamp was a quite nice perk-
Thank God Python doesn't need rhyme!
